# About the template
This template includes the complete arc42 structure, based on version 8.2 from January 2023. It uses only functions from the Professional Edition to support all editions of Enterprise Architect. The template implementation uses UML diagrams and text documents, where diagrams are not suitable. Some parts, like the glossary and risks use extended UML.

# Note on Enterprise Architect Versions
The template is provided in a QEA and EAPX file format. QEA was introduced in EA 16 and is based on SQlite3. EAPX is the older default file format, which uses JET 4 as the repository database. This format should be supported with EA 15 and below. 

If you are using a version earlier than EA 14, you want to rename the EAPX extension to EAP. Pre EA 14 you could use JET 3.5 or JET 4 in EAP files. In version 14, this was made explicit by introducing EPAX for JET 4 and using EAP for JET 3.5.

If you only want to view a model, have a look at EA Lite edition, which is offered free of charge and can be downloaded here: https://www.sparxsystems.eu/enterprise-architect/ea-lite-edition

# How to use
1. Download the QAE or EAPX file in the language of your choice (DE or EN).
2. Copy the template to your target location and rename it.
3. Optional (see "Note on Enterprise Architect Version): Rename the file extension from EAPX to EAP.
4. Open the file.
5. Edit all the files according to your needs. You will find the official arc42 explanation provided as notes directly in the corresponding diagrams. Where needed, I added some additional help.
6. You can delete the "Info" package if you want. It only contains meta information to the arc42 template.
